Instructions for Installing Compass/sass with Ruby
!) Sync GitHub

1) Install Ruby using Ruby Installer
2) Check top two boxes during install (Install Tcl/TK suppport & Add Ruby executables to your PATH)
3) Once installed open up CMD line
4) run "gem update system"
5) run "gem install compass"

To have compass compile your files you need to have compass watch the directory that your .scss files are in.
you can also use sass install and sass watch but compass has other features (learn about setting up sass here: http://www.impressivewebs.com/sass-on-windows/).

1) Change Dir to your folder: ex(cd C:\Users\OLOPEZ\Sites\devdesktop\Agriculture\sites\all\themes\purduebootsass\)
2) "compass watch"
3) Alternatively you can create a .bat file to do this
